When sorting old or deconstructed lumber there seem to be four categories: fill or compost (non pressure treated, rotten), firewood (non-pressure-treated, relatively dry, split or broken), landfill (unusable pressure-treated, plywood, painted), and usable (intact, not too wet or rotten).

I prioritize saving PT since it has to go to the landfill otherwise: removing screws and nails, cutting wire, etc.
